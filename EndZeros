Try to find out how many zeros a given number has at the end.

Input: A positive Int

Output: An Int.

Example:

end_zeros(0) == 1
end_zeros(1) == 0
end_zeros(10) == 1
end_zeros(101) == 0

str.strip method of string object. Return a copy of the string with the leading and trailing characters removed.


def end_zeros(num: int) -> int:
    n = str(num)
    return len(n) - len(n.strip('0'))

#TESTING

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Example:")
    print(end_zeros(0))

    # These "asserts" are used for self-checking and not for an auto-testing
    assert end_zeros(0) == 1
    assert end_zeros(1) == 0
    assert end_zeros(10) == 1
    assert end_zeros(101) == 0
    assert end_zeros(245) == 0
    assert end_zeros(100100) == 2
